# 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere Model
# r/dataisbeautiful's DataViz Battle for December 2019

## Background
December 2019 Reddit's r/dataisbeautiful's DataViz Battle deals with the 1976 version of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere Model. While the dataset itself is small (about 50 datapoints total, and some say the same things but in different units.) what it describes is incredibly complex. More background research is required here to understand what claims are reasonable. 

Some isualizations are also right below the dataset provided, and it seems silly just to re-create one of those. Therefore a second dataset or model should be included here. (perhaps something about aircraft or rocket preformance, or total amounts of molecular mass in each atmospheric level?)
